Exercise 1
==========

1. Buy a book about C++
2. Install a C++ compiler
3. Run the "Hello World" example
4. Implement a fraction data type

Exercise 2
==========

1. ...
2. Separate compilation
3. Implement an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation Calculator)
4. Implement a simple spell checker

Exercise 3
==========

1. Implement a program that shows a function that cannot be inlined
2. Implement the persistent vector data type and extend the RPN calculator such
   that it uses the persistent vector for the stack of the numbers.
3. Convert the RPN calculator to make use of templates, so that it can be used
   with any number data type (e.g., the Fraction data type).
   Add the operation 'm' that computes the minimum of the top two numbers.

Exercise 4
==========

1. Adapt the persistent pvector to make use of a persister trait.
   Implement a pset that implements a persistent set (based on std::set).
2. Extend your dictionary program such that it allows the user to correct
   unknown words or insert them into the dictionary.
   Make use of your pset implementation form 1.
3. Change your RPN calculator such that the minimum function computes the
   minimum of all the numbers stored on the stack. Make use of std::for_each.
4. Implement a program that demonstrates the use of combineops_t.

Exercise 5
==========

1. Implement a simple program that demonstates in what order constructors and
   destructors being executed when an object is constructed or destructed
   respectively.
2. Rectangle as base of Square or vice versa?

Exercise 6
==========

1. Implement a function that merges the elements of two containers.
2. Elevator Controller (long description)
3. Connect Four (4 Gewinnt)
