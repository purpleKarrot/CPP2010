Exercise 1
Have a look at the multi-method slides and come up with a
solution of how to solve it until the next lecture. Implement your
solution â€“ you should be able to demonstrate your solution in the
first 10 minutes of the next lecture.

Exercise 3
Extend your RPN calculator in a way that numbers can be
displayed in different representations. For example, the user
should get the option to choose between scientific, engineering,
and standard format or possibly as fraction. Use the formatting
commands we learned in this lecture.
